							<h4>Agribusiness and Rural Entrepreneurship Development</h4>
						</div>
						<p class="first">Many developing countries and economies in transition, particularly those with large rural communities, suffer from inadequate access to food and lack of employment. The problem is compounded by the dependence on outdated and inefficient technologies leading to poor productivity and slow economic growth.</p>
						<p class="second">Agriculture-based industrial products account for half of all exports from developing countries, yet only 30 per cent of those exports involve processed goods compared to a figure of 98 per cent in the developed world.</p>
						<p class="third">In this context, EP-Africa aims to promote sustainable, inclusive business opportunities for the rural poor through agri-business and agro-value chain development. EP-Africa's technical cooperation  activities in this regard focus on adding value to agricultural commodities including non-food sectors at various points of the chain of economic transactions that links input providers, farmers, traders, processors, logistic providers, distributors and retailers.</p>
						<p class="first">Through its technical assistance, EP-Africa links resources and markets in the agribusiness value chains and strengthens forward and backward industrial linkages in order to leg up the economic transformation of rural communities, improve employment and income opportunities, and reinforce sustainable l ivelihoods.</p>
						<p class="first">Agro-industrial activities benefit a number of groups, including poor and marginalized rural populations, urban agro-industries and communities facing human security challenges or requiring urgent supplies of agricultural equipment and the rehabilitation of food industries. Technical cooperation and capacity-building services are provided to agro-based and agro-related businesses and industries, inter alia, in the food, leather, textiles, wood and agricultural equipment sectors.</p>
						<p class="first">To carry out its mandate in this area, EP-Africa promotes investment in agribusiness and value chain development; builds partnerships and linkages with strategic financing institutions, capacity building of agribusinesses/SMEs to make them investment ready and facilitation of their access to finance by connecting them with impact investors, commercial finance and blended finance sources. EP-Africa also facilitates agricultural input and output market access for Smallholder farmers, Farmer Based Organizational and Cooperatives Development.</p><br><br>

							<h4>Women and Youth in Productive Activities</h4>
						</div>
						<p class="first">Women and youth face distinct challenges in participating in the productive sectors of the economy. Although women and youth are not a homogeneous group and their circumstances vary according to age, class, education, ethnicity, location and other cultural- and socio-economic characteristics, it is widely acknowledged that women and youth bear a disproportionate burden of global poverty.
						</p>
						<p class="first">Large and growing youth unemployment threatens sustainable development and social stability, and women continue to experience barriers in almost every aspect of economic life. Women suffer from persistent social and cultural discrimination and unequal access to and control over assets and services.</p>
						<p class="first">The primary focus of EP-Africa’s activities in this area is on the knowledge, skills, technologies and business support services needed to enable women and youth to engage in productive activities, generate income, and thereby reduce poverty.This is achieved through capacity-building activities aimed at equipping women and youth with the necessary knowledge, skills and attitudes to seize economic opportunities, gain control of their lives and exert influence in society.</p>
						<p class="first">Gender equality is promoted by increasing opportunities for both girls and boys, for example through education and the ability to make vocational choices that combat gender divisions in the labour market.

							<h4>Local Content and SMEs Supplier Development</h4>
						</div>

Our approach is a comprehensive demand and supply side business diagnosis study to identify available business opportunities and business constraints which informs the design and implementation of appropriate Local content and SMEs business linkages and supplier development program.
						</p><br><br>
						<div class="widget-title">
							<h4>Supporting small and medium industry clusters</h4>
						</div>
						<p class="first">In Ghana, the private sector mainly consists of micro, small and medium enterprises that generate a large share of employment and income opportunities. Often, however, their development potential remains untapped, as firms operate in isolation, are locked into uncompetitive production patterns and unable to approach dynamic business partners that could bring in new expertise and know how.</p>
						<p class="first">EP-Africa aims to boost the development of a competitive private sector and contribute to poverty reduction by building sustainable linkages between small-size enterprises, their larger scale business partners and support institutions.</p>
						<p class="first">Linkages enhance enterprise competitiveness through the realization of economies of scale and scope and are a source of sustainability, as they increase the capacity of the economic actors to collectively react to crisis and turning points. Linkages also pave the way for broad-based and inclusive development, where poor entrepreneurs and workers participate in economic activities on fair terms.</p>

						<div class="widget-title">
							<h4>Safeguarding the Environment: Energy Access for Productive use</h4>
						</div>
						<p class="first">Enhancing access to modern and reliable energy supplies is widely regarded as a prerequisite for economic development in developing countries and countries with economies in transition. For such development to be sustainable, this energy must be used to promote productive uses that create jobs and more income-generating opportunities for local communities.</p>
						<p class="second">Given the growing gap between energy supply and demand, renewable energy has assumed a critical role in meeting the rising demand for energy, especially by industry, in developing countries. Several renewable energy technologies have emerged as economically viable and environmentally friendly options, which if suitably adopted, can meet growing energy needs of industry, and particularly of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).</p>
						<p class="third">EP-Africa enables Ghana increase its competitiveness through the use of renewable energy, thus achieving sustainable low-carbon industrial development. It is responsible for enhancing the use of renewable sources of energy and efficient use of energy by industry, and for facilitating access to affordable and sustainable energy to support productive activities and the income and employment opportunities they create, thereby contributing to the mitigation of climate change.</p>
						<p class="first">EP-Africa provides Technical Assistance for SMEs and large companies to understand the impacts of their business operations on the environment and their operational communities. Based on the outcome of environmental and economic impact Assessment study, policies, programs and projects are formulated to mitigate adverse effects of business operations on the environment and project impacted communities.</p><br><br>
