						</p><br><br>
						<div class="widget-title">
							<h4>Transparency and Good Governance</h4>
						</div>
						<p class="first">Corruption is undoubtedly the most pressing governance and development challenge that Africa is confronted with today. Corruption has debilitating and corrosive effects on progress, stability and development of the continent. It impedes economic growth by discouraging foreign investments, creates distortion in resource allocation and competitive markets, increases the cost of doing business, and reduces the net-value of public spending. It also reduces the quality of services and public infrastructure and the volume of tax revenues, and encourages the misappropriation and misallocation of scarce resources. In the political realm, it undermines the rule of law, respect for human rights, accountability and transparency and weakens government institutions. This in turn erodes public legitimacy in government and compromises good governance.  The social costs of corruption are also deleterious as it deepens income inequality, poverty and adversely affects good moral values in the society. In general, corruption is a challenge to sustainable economic development, peace and good governance.</p>

						<p class="second">While corruption is a global phenomenon, the impact is felt more in poor and underdeveloped countries (which Ghana is no exception), where resources for development are unduly diverted into private hands, which exacerbates poverty. According to the 2005 African Governance Report (AGR I), corruption is perceived as the most serious national problem next to poverty and unemployment.</p>

						<p class="third">In an effort to ensure transparency and good governance, Escape Poverty–Africa will work to build capacity of citizens, particularly women to participate in decision making processes and demand accountability from leaders and government officials. We believe that corruption will reduce if leaders and government officials become aware that the citizens are interested in their activities and they expect them to be accountable.</p><br><br>
